## Title: 
Leaky Jeans: Out of Pocket Edition. 

## Description:
Leaky Jeans: OPE is a 2D side-scrolling/platformer time-attack game where the player controls a pair of jeans and tries to maneuver their way to the end of the level as quickly as they can. The main gimmick of the game is that the jeans you control are very wet and leaking water. The more you run, the more you leak and dry off. By the end of the level you gain additional points based off of how wet you were when finishing. Along the way, the player must overcome level hazards, enemies, and most important of all they must find and obtain more water to wet their jeans since they will be losing water as they move through the level. 


## Game Flow:
Leaky Jeans: OPE will flow very similarly to other side-scrolling 2D platformer games. The player starts at one side of the level and runs towards the other end until the finish line is met. Levels are expected to be short and simple providing enough time for the player to encounter new challenges with hazards, enemies, or finding more water to wet their jeans but not long enough for them to get bored of any given level. Time also plays a part when talking about game flow. Because of the un-lengthy levels, time to complete will be be short as well; Roughly taking (maximum) 1 minute to complete a level. This allows levels to remain quick to finish while being challenging for the player to finish in the time provided.

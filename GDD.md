## Title: 
Leaky Jeans: Out of Pocket Edition. 

## Description:
Leaky Jeans: OPE is a 2D side-scrolling/platformer time-attack game where the player controls a pair of jeans and tries to maneuver their way to the end of the level as quickly as they can. The main gimmick of the game is that the jeans you control are very wet and leaking water. The more you run, the more you leak and dry off. By the end of the level you gain additional points based off of how wet you were when finishing. Along the way, the player must overcome level hazards, enemies, and most important of all they must find and obtain more water to wet their jeans since they will be losing water as they move through the level. 


## Game Flow:
Leaky Jeans: OPE will flow very similarly to other side-scrolling 2D platformer games. The player starts at one side of the level and runs towards the other end until the finish line is met. Levels are expected to be short and simple providing enough time for the player to encounter new challenges with hazards, enemies, or finding more water to wet their jeans but not long enough for them to get bored of any given level. Time also plays a part when talking about game flow. Because of the un-lengthy levels, time to complete will be be short as well; Roughly taking (maximum) 1 minute to complete a level. This allows levels to remain quick to finish while being challenging for the player to finish in the time provided. 


## Gameplay Mechanics:
* ### Wetness: will be gained by water pick-up and lost overtime by running/moving or by hazards


* ### Movement/Controls: 
	Fairly simple controls player; can move left and right and be able to jump

* ### Leaderboard:
	Compare your score with other players; compete with others for the quickest wet jeans.

* ### Achievements: 
	Achievements will be included to give an additional bonus challenge to the player. Examples include: finishing levels within a certain time, finishing levels with a certain amount of wetness, etc.

* ### Pick-ups:
  * **Water**: increases one's wetness by 25%. Being the one of the main mechanics of the game, it is important for the player to be able to regain any lost water throughout the level.

* ### Hazards:
  * **Holes:** death pits that have the player lose a substantial amount of wetness and be sent back a certain point
  * **Spikes:** shred the jeans causing quicker loss of water
  * **Oil Spills:** will take up a portion of the user’s wetness

## Characters:
* ### Player:
  * **Jeans:** The player will control a pair of jeans named Gene-- a friendly pair of pants who loves water.
* ### Enemies:
  * **Time:** The main ‘enemy’ of the game is not actually one you can see. Finish the level before time runs out, or Game Over.
  * **Fan-Fan:** Roaming humanoid fans that will blow air towards the player when they are too close, drying them off and making them lose wetness.

## Environment:
* ### Style:
	Leaky Jeans: OPE will be a cartoon retro-styled 16-bit game. Drawing on the feeling of older 2D games of an alike genre, the game will bring back the nostalgia of being in an arcade but on your mobile device. 

* ### Game World
* ### Objects:
  * #### Non-tangible:
	* **Background:** sky  
  * #### Tangible:
	* **Platforms**
	* **Enemies:** spikes(rip your pants), hole(player falls and after a determined time respawns at the closest checkpoint)
